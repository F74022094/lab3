# lab3
I wnat to do it in my program class
I input make -f makelab3 to compile in question a
in question b,the result is

while const int size=1000
sort(): 0
seconds
v1 and v2 are
different.
insertion_sort():
0 seconds
v1 and v2 are
the same.
while const size=10000
sort(): 0
seconds
v1 and v2 are
different.
insertion_sort():
1.28 seconds
v1 and v2 are
the same.
while const size=100000
sort(): 0.04
seconds
because the insertion sort need to run  n^2 seconds,so when const size become larger ,it need to run longer.
